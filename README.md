# NST
Neural Style Transfer

This is a technique based on deep convulational neural networks by which we can apply some specified style from an image (Style image) to a required image(Content image)
This project is mainly based on the works of Leon Gatys with some few modifications which include the artist style representations or generalisation of a particular artist we want our content image to possess.
